This repository is centered around answering the question: Can we predict the winner of League of Legends Tournament?


Data Cleaning and Aquisition: Anirudh Agaram

  Data was obtained from Oracle Elixir (https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads). The dataset that showed team data from 2022 was used. 
  Only complete team data was filtered from the dataset. Once the complete team data remained, league, side, position, teamname, result, kills, assists,
       teamkills, doublekills, team kpm, dragons, elementaldrakes,
       dragons (type unknown), 'irstbaron, barons, towers,
       firstmidtower, firsttothreetowers, inhibitors, earnedgold,
       earned gpm, gspd, golddiffat10, golddiffat15, and xpdiffat15 remained in the dataset. The filtering was done by making the dataset into a correlation matrix and finding the features that correlated highest with the result of the match (win/loss).


Decision Tree Classifier : Haizhou Wang

Firstly, I chose to use decision trees for prediction for several reasonsï¼š
1. decision trees have very easy to understand decision rules
2. decision trees can handle non-linear features
3. the interactions between variables are taken into account
The prediction model based on the decision tree can reach 97.386% accuracy
In the final distribution of importance, it can be seen that the number of towers plays a crucial role in winning or losing a match, followed by earnded gmp, team death and team kills
